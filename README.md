# TrailWeather

This is an app that uses the DARK SKY API along with the HIKING PROJECT API, and MAPBOX to make a website that will show trails around a location that you can search, and the weather in that location, so that you will have a better idea on what gear to bring, or just when to go on your hike. This project builds upon the skills that we learned before the first project and adds a whole new layer of complexity by utilizing Node.JS and a wide variety of node modules to bring together a full stack application. Here is a link to the project: LINK 

## Day 1 

Today I spent the time I had completely for planning and setting up the foundation of this project. I decided that because of the scale of this project compared to the previous one that I wanted to use a wireframing website to help plan things better, so I settled on using FIGMA, a great designing tool. Here is my basic wireframe with small design ideas and plans on each page:

Other than making that I also wrote down a good 4 to 5 pages of notes on things that I would need to either think about or include in this project. One of the most important pages here is my routes and database plan page, where I made up all of the routes based on the database that I designed to fit the needs of the project. 

## Day 2 
Today my main focus for the morning was to make sure that all of my routes hit along with making sure that I got all of the information on the page that I would need to display. Once that was done...
